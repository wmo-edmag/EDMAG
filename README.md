# Environmental Data Management Advisory Group
*Terms of Reference*

## Purpose
The Environmental Data Management Advisory Group (EDMAG) provides expert advice and coordination on environmental data management. Its role is to support globally consistent operational services, strengthen data interoperability, and promote cooperation with international partners.

## Objectives
1. Promote standardisation – Work towards common data formats, processes, and software interfaces.
2. Test and provide feedback on standards – Provide evidence-based recommendations for improvements, or extensions to, WMO standards.
3. Develop reference implementations – Create, test, and maintain practical examples of WMO standards in use.
4. Share knowledge – Keep members informed of relevant activities in Expert Teams and Task Teams, and raise awareness of new tools and solutions.
5. Support Members – Offer guidance and best practices to help WMO Members adopt and apply data management standards effectively.

## Initial tasks

With the support of a wide collaborator network of future experts (where "future expert" is defined as a contributor who's experience is currently limited to their own organisation's practices):

1. Extend WCCDM-OBS with additional schema(s) to make it useful in practice
2. Demonstrate the use of PROV with WCCDM-OBS to provide full provenance metadata
3. Survey collaborator network, document current practices and propose standardised methodology for:
    - Quality control and error checking
    - Infilling of missing data in a time-series
    - Disaggregation of cumulative rainfall
4. Specific requirements on tolerances for missing data when calculating means, or in the case of AWSs, daily extremes (is a daily maximum temperature still valid for climate purposes when half an hour or an hour's data from an AWS stream is missing?)
